## About Me

A highly inquisitive and enthusiastic software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, bringing in a strong foundation in full-stack web development. Previously, I honed my skills through self-study with online resources, gaining a solid understanding of programming fundamentals. My time at Makers Academy further developed these skills, as I learned best practices for writing clean, test driven code as well as collaborated in groups through agile to build full-stack projects (like this [one](https://mer-nsters-inc.vercel.app/)) which helped boost my communication and teamwork skills.

What made me want to become a developer was the fun and engaging problem solving loop that rewards you for experimenting with different solutions. The wonderful community of developers all of whom are willing to help each other out is what makes me love this field and is also the reason I was able to get hooked from a young age. I'm looking for a role where I can continue to learn and improve my skills as well as help others do the same.

## Work Experience

Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Provided exceptional customer service by warmly greeting and attentively listening to individual needs, while offering courteous assistance with merchandise selection and purchase completion, resulting in loyal, profitable customer relationships.
- Accepted and processed cash, card and mobile payments using POS systems and check products are in date and ensure inventory count is accurate.
- Prepare deliveries with precision and attention to detail while also being mindful of time constraints.
- Maintain store organisation standards to improve productivity for myself and colleagues whilst putting out stock.

## Skills

**Team Player**

- I always try and be helpful. An example being when we were looking to add swipe functionality to a web [app](https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc), which none of us had experience with, and I strategically volunteered to learn and employ the tech for this which lead to the team being able to focus on solving other problems and increase our overall speed.
- Whenever I find a useful resource that helped me I would share it with the team so we could all benefit from it. Usually this would be a blog post or video that explained a concept in a way that made sense to me. This usually leads to more time being spent on the actual work and less time spent on learning.
- In labs where we were given a task to complete in a group, I would work flexibly to what the team needed. That includes taking on more challenging work and offering leadership where required.
- I am capable of working in most roles and am able to adapt to any situation. This also means when staff members go sick I am often asked to cover their shifts as I am reliable and can be trusted to do the job well.

**Self motivated**

- I'm always working on side projects with the goals of widening my knowledge. For example, I took on the goal of creating a multiplayer Monopoly game which is a big step up from creating CRUD applications. Overall, challenging myself regularly keeps me engaged and helps me learn new skills.
- I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. Go is a slightly less popular language meaning resources for learning it are limited so I had to improve my ability to learn from documentation.
- To keep myself immersed in this field I follow a number of blogs and YouTube channels. This helps me stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies as well as learn new concepts and techniques. For example, my understanding of the importance of docker and microservices was greatly improved by watching these type of videos.

**Adaptable**

- When teaching myself coding I found that I had a natural aptitude for it. This meant I was able to quickly adapt to Makers Academy's curriculum and was able to pick up new concepts and technologies quickly. This made the transition from Javascript to Ruby (and then to Go) much easier than I expected. This allowed me to offer help to others even when working in a language I have never used before.
- I keep the business efficient by varying my roles so I can understand the needs of all the different people I work with. This allows me to better use any spare time. For example when closing the shop I already know what might be helpful for those opening so I can make preparations for them and ensure they can start working immediately.

**Great Attention to detail**

- I thoroughly test merged code before pushing to the main branch. I always make sure my contributions only do what they are supposed to do and don't break anything else. I am also very strict with following the style guide such as with commit names and file structure.
- I try and make sure my code is as efficient as possible, whilst also being maintainable, and that it is easy to read and understand. When completing the 'Bank Tech Test' I employed SOLID and OOP principles which overall made the code easier to extend and maintain.
- During experiments, usually a high degree of precision is required in order to collect lab results, which I was able to do by carefully following instructions and double checking my work. Otherwise small mistakes would add up and correlations would be missed.
- At my retail job, I am often asked to check the stock count as I am able to spot mistakes and inconsistencies. I am often given the responsibility of re-organising the stock room as I am able to quickly find the most efficient way to do so.

**Customer focused**

- Conversing with many customers daily has helped me develop my communication skills. My strong pattern recognition skills helps me anticipate a customer's needs allowing me to help them more efficiently.
- I keep to company policy despite the fact that it can be frustrating for customers and am able to remain calm and proffesional in these situations. This is because I understand that it is important to follow the rules in order to maintain a good reputation and keep the business running smoothly.

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, collaborative code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of programming and web development that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Used for writing client and server side code.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects. We created our own database management classes as well as used ORMs.
- MERN: Built a facebook clone and friendmaking app where everyone got to experience coding in both sides of the stack.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Dissertation: ​​Screen of known kinase inhibitors to eEF2K homology model with structure analysis.​ (Used computers to model the structure of a protein and then used this to screen for inhibitors as a potential treatment for cancer.)

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A\*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.
