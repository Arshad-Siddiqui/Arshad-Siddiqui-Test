# Arshad Siddiqui (Work in progress) ðŸ› 

I'm a junior full stack web developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp. A few months prior, I was self teaching using online resources where I had loads of fun learning programming concepts, syntax and how to think algorithmically about a problem.

At bootcamp is where I learned TDD, debugging, writing clean maintainable code as well as effective communication for working within a team. I also learnt how to build projects from scratch collaboratively with git and pair programming.

What drew me to the field was my passion for problem solving. I find it to be the easiest way of learning something as it properly engages your mind and it happens at your own pace. I've also loved tech from a young age and would obsess about tech news due to how exciting and innovative the field always is.

## Work Experience
Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.
- Maintain organisation to improve productivity of the next set of colleagues continuing the work.
- Quickly adapt to store conditions in order to get the most critical work done first.
- Use own intuition as well as know when to ask management questions in order to keep up efficiency.

## Skills

- **Team Player** - In projects I am always looking forward to helping others, whether that be in filling knowledge and trying to get people over blockers, to taking on the more challenging work and offering leadership where required. This has lead to more of the team being able to work together and increase the speed at which we reach deadlines.
- **Self motivation** - To improve as a developer I set a goal to code everyday. This has lead to me picking up patterns and concepts so regardless of the stack I am able to think and offer solutions to problems. I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. I also enjoy educational media such as videos which help break down new concepts for me such as Docker and new beneficial libraries/tools.
- **Adaptable** - I love learning new stacks and incorporating concepts learnt from previous experience into them. For bootcamp I learnt Ruby fairly rapidly as well as spent two weeks learning the MERN stack in order to submit a project written in it at the end of the two weeks. Ruby as a language is really simple and rarely gets in the way so was a great introductory language to learning testing which carried over to Javascript and Golang.
- **Problem solving** - In order to get a deeper understanding of how something works, I play around with it like how a tester or scientist would. This is really useful when it comes to bug fixing as this approach is great for figuring out why something behaves a certain way. 
- **Attention to detail** - Whenever I find a solution, with version control, I comb over the changes and make sure only the necessary code gets added. Often times whilst problem solving, changes get made that don't do anything but ruin the tidyness of the codebase which this technique removes.

### Technology
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, gin, testing library + testify/Ginkgo)
- MongoDb/Postgres
- Firebase, Postman, Heroku

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, compatible code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of coding that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Learnt how to use these for front and backend code.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects with them. We created our own database management classes as well as used ODMs/ORMs to control the database.
- MERN: 2/3 of our projects used this stack and we were able to make a facebook clone and friendmaking app similar to tinder.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.

## Interests
