## About Me

A highly inquisitive and enthusiastic software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, bringing a strong foundation in full-stack web development to the table. Previously, I honed my skills through self-study with online resources, gaining a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, such as OOP and efficient algorithm creation. My time at Makers Academy further developed these skills, as I learned best practices for writing clean, test driven code as well as collaborated in groups to build full-stack projects which also helped boost my communication and teamwork skills.

What made me want to become a developer was the fun and engaging problem solving loop that rewards you for learning and improving. The vast resources available for learning it are very accessible so I was able to experience coding at a young age and have been hooked ever since. I'm looking for a role where I can continue to learn and improve my skills as well as help others do the same.

## Work Experience

Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.
- Maintain organisation to improve productivity for me and my colleagues.
- Quickly adapt to store conditions and correctly prioritise the most critical work.
- Manage tills, put out stock and prepare deliveries.
- Check products are in date and ensure inventory count is accurate.

## Skills

**Team Player**

- In group projects I try and get people over blockers, as well as taking on challenging work and offering leadership where required.
- An example being when we were looking to add swipe functionality to an [app](https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc), which none of us had experience with, and I strategically volunteered to learn and employ the tech for this which lead to the team being able to focus on solving other problems and increase our overall speed.
- When staff members go sick I am often asked to cover their shifts as I am reliable and can be trusted to do the job well.
- In labs where we were given a task to complete in a group, I would often work equally with everyone to ensure we all understood the task and could complete it.

**Self motivated**

- I'm always working on side projects with the goals of widening my knowledge as well as polishing skills I feel need improvement. For example, I took on the goal of creating a multiplayer Monopoly game which will use WebSockets, which is new to me, and will also use CSS grid and the useDrag library which I have used before but need improvement on. Overall, this has lead to me picking up patterns and concepts so regardless of the stack I am able to think and offer solutions to problems. For example, learning testing and API structure using Ruby meant I was able to quickly pick up the same in Javascript.
- I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. I also enjoy educational media such as videos which help break down new concepts for me such as Docker and new language features.
- I have a desire to be a great, well rounded developer so I can offer more help to others.

**Adaptable**

- In my final Makers project I was predominantly working in the backend until issues arised in the frontend to which I had to quickly re-adjust myself.
- I learnt Ruby quite rapidly and spent two weeks learning the MERN stack in order to submit a project within a deadline.

**Problem solver**

- I've learnt to experiment with code to properly deduce why problems occur.
- I try and select more difficult tickets in order to speed up my improvement.

**Attention to detail**

- With version control, I comb over the changes and make sure only the solution code gets added. When reviewing a pull request I always test the merged code works before it reaches the main branch.

### Technology

- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Node, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, Fiber, testing library + testify/Ginkgo)

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, collaborative code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of programming and web development that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Used for writing client and server side code.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects. We created our own database management classes as well as used ORMs.
- MERN: Built a facebook clone and friendmaking app where everyone got to experience coding in both sides of the stack.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A\*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.
