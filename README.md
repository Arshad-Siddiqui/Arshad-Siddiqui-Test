## About Me

A highly inquisitive and enthusiastic software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, bringing a strong foundation in full-stack web development to the table. Previously, I honed my skills through self-study with online resources, gaining a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, such as OOP and efficient algorithm creation. My time at Makers Academy further developed these skills, as I learned best practices for writing clean, test driven code as well as collaborated in groups to build full-stack projects which also helped boost my communication and teamwork skills.

What made me want to become a developer was the fun and engaging problem solving loop that rewards you for learning and improving. The vast resources available for learning it are very accessible so I was able to experience coding at a young age and have been hooked ever since. I'm looking for a role where I can continue to learn and improve my skills as well as help others do the same.

## Work Experience

Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.
- Maintain organisation to improve productivity for me and my colleagues.
- Quickly adapt to store conditions and correctly prioritise the most critical work.
- Manage tills, put out stock and prepare deliveries.
- Check products are in date and ensure inventory count is accurate.

## Skills

**Team Player**

- I always try and be helpful. An example being when we were looking to add swipe functionality to an [app](https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc), which none of us had experience with, and I strategically volunteered to learn and employ the tech for this which lead to the team being able to focus on solving other problems and increase our overall speed.
- In labs where we were given a task to complete in a group, I would work flexibly to what the team needed. That includes taking on more challenging work and offering leadership where required.
- Whenever I find a useful resource that helped me I would share it with the team so we could all benefit from it. Usually this would be a blog post or video that explained a concept in a way that made sense to me.
- At Iceland's I am capable of working in most roles and am able to adapt to any situation. Whether that be quickly helping out a busy till or working in the backroom to help with deliveries. This also means when staff members go sick I am often asked to cover their shifts as I am reliable and can be trusted to do the job well.

**Self motivated**

- I'm always working on side projects with the goals of widening my knowledge as well as polishing skills I feel need improvement. For example, I took on the goal of creating a multiplayer Monopoly game which is a big step up from creating CRUD applications. Overall, this has lead to me picking up patterns and concepts so regardless of the stack I am able to think and offer solutions to problems. For example, learning testing and API structure using Ruby meant I was able to quickly pick up the same in Javascript.
- I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. I also enjoy educational media such as videos which help break down new concepts for me such as Docker and new language features.

**Adaptable**

- When teaching myself coding I found that I had a natural aptitude for it. This meant I was able to quickly adapt to Makers Academy's curriculum and was able to pick up new concepts and technologies quickly. This made the transition from Typescript to Ruby (and then to Go) much easier than I expected.

**Attention to detail**

- I thoroughly test merged code before pushing to the main branch. I always make sure my contributions only do what they are supposed to do and don't break anything else.
- Usually a high degree of precision is required in order to collect lab results, which I was able to do by carefully following instructions and double checking my work. Otherwise small mistakes would add up and correlations would be missed.
- At my retail job, I am often asked to check the stock count as I am able to spot mistakes and inconsistencies.
- Having code that simply works isn't enough for me, I like to make sure it is as efficient as possible and that it is easy to read and understand. When completing the 'Bank Tech Test' I employed SOLID and OOP principles. An example being dependency injection which allows for easily testable code as well as .

### Technology

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Node, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, Fiber, testing library + testify/Ginkgo, GORM)
- MongoDb/Postgres
- Firebase, Postman, Heroku, TablePlus
- Docker

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, collaborative code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of programming and web development that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Used for writing client and server side code.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects. We created our own database management classes as well as used ORMs.
- MERN: Built a facebook clone and friendmaking app where everyone got to experience coding in both sides of the stack.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Dissertation: ​​Screen of known kinase inhibitors to eEF2K homology model with structure analysis.​ (Used computers to model the structure of a protein and then used this to screen for inhibitors)

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A\*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.
