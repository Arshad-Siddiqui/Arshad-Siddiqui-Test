# Arshad Siddiqui (Work in progress) üõ†
I'm a junior full stack web developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp. A few months prior, I was self teaching using online resources such as codecademy, freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project; where I had loads of fun learning syntax and how to think algorithmically about a problem.

What drew me to the field was my passion for problem solving as well as its fast pace. At bootcamp is where I learned plenty of things which I didn't consider important at the time such as TDD, writing clean maintainable code as well as effective communication for working within a team. I also learnt how important building larger projects were to learning as compared to grinding away at problems on codewars.

## Projects

Name | Description | Stack | Build Time | Access
-----|-------------|-------|------------|--------
go-bank-tech-test | Tech test demonstrating process | Go (Ginkgo, Testify) | 3-4 days | [Repo](https://github.com/Arshad-Siddiqui/go-bank-tech-test)
FriendZone | App for finding friends | Javascript (MERN, Vitest, useGesture, TailWind, BCrypt, Firebase) | 2 weeks, 6 people | [Repo](https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc)

## Experience

## Skills

- **Team Player** - Always looking forward to helping others. Whether that be filling in knowledge gaps and ensuring everyone knows what each other is working on to even taking on the more challenging work and offering leadership where required.
- **Self motivation** - I set myself a goal to code every single day and make sure I am always improving as a developer. I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms.
- **Adaptable** - I love learning new stacks and incorporating concepts learnt from previous experience into them. For bootcamp I learnt Ruby fairly rapidly as well as spent two weeks learning the MERN stack in order to submit a project written in it at the end of the two weeks.

### Technology
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, gin, testing library + testify/Ginkgo)
