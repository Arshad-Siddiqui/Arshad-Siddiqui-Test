# Arshad Siddiqui

I'm a junior full stack web developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy Bootcamp. Prior, I was self teaching using online resources where I had loads of fun learning programming fundamentals and how to solve algorithmic problems. Bootcamp is where I learned how to write clean code and work collaboratively as a team enabling me to build full stack projects.

What drew me to the field was my passion for problem solving and how it allows you to learn in a variety of creative ways. Similar to science, you're encouraged to explore and play with things to get a deeper understanding. I've also loved tech from a young age and would get excited due to how  innovative the field is.

## Work Experience
Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.
- Maintain organisation to improve productivity me and my colleagues.
- Quickly adapt to store conditions and correctly prioritise the most critical work.

## Skills

- **Team Player** - In projects I am always looking forward to helping others, whether that be filling in knowledge and trying to get people over blockers, to taking on the more challenging work and offering leadership where required. An example being when we were looking to add swipe functionality to an app, which none of us had experience with, and I strategically volunteered to learn and employ the tech for this which lead to the team being able to focus on solving other problems and increase our speed in order to reach a deadline.
- **Self motivation** - To improve as a developer I set a goal to code everyday. This has lead to me picking up patterns and concepts so regardless of the stack I am able to think and offer solutions to problems. I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. I also enjoy educational media such as videos which help break down new concepts for me such as Docker and new language features.
- **Adaptable** - I love learning new stacks and incorporating concepts learnt from previous experience into them. For bootcamp I learnt Ruby fairly rapidly as well as spent two weeks learning the MERN stack in order to submit a project written in it at the end of the two weeks. Ruby as a language is really simple and rarely gets in the way so was a great introductory language to learning testing which carried over to Javascript and Golang.
- **Problem solving** - In order to get a deeper understanding of how something works, I play around with it like how a tester or scientist would. This is really useful when it comes to bug fixing as this approach is great for figuring out why something behaves a certain way.
- **Attention to detail** - Whenever I find a solution, with version control, I comb over the changes and make sure only the necessary code gets added. Often times whilst experimenting, changes get made that don't do anything but ruin the tidyness of the codebase which this technique prevents.

### Technology
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Node, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, Fiber, testing library + testify/Ginkgo)
- MongoDb/Postgres
- Firebase, Postman, Heroku, TablePlus
- Docker

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, collaborative code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of coding that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Learnt how to use these for running in the browser as well as node.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects. We created our own database management classes as well as used ORMs to control the database.
- MERN: Built a facebook clone and friendmaking app where everyone got to experience coding in both sides of the stack.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.
