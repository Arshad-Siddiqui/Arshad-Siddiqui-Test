# Arshad Siddiqui (Work in progress) üõ†

I'm a junior full stack web developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp. A few months prior, I was self teaching using online resources where I had loads of fun learning programming concepts, syntax and how to think algorithmically about a problem.

At bootcamp is where I learned TDD, writing clean maintainable code as well as effective communication for working within a team. I also learnt how to build projects from scratch collaboratively with git and pair programming.

What drew me to the field was my passion for problem solving as well as its fast pace. I've also loved tech from a young age and would obsess about tech news due to how exciting and innovative the field always is.

## Projects

Name | Description | Stack | Build Time | Access

## Work Experience
Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.

## Skills

- **Team Player** - In projects I am always looking forward to helping others, whether that be in filling knowledge and trying to get people over blockers, to taking on the more challenging work and offering leadership where required. This has lead to more of the team being able to work together and increase the speed at which we reach deadlines.
- **Self motivation** - To improve as a developer I set a goal to code everyday. This has lead to me picking up patterns and concepts so regardless of the stack I am able to think and offer solutions to problems. I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms.
- **Adaptable** - I love learning new stacks and incorporating concepts learnt from previous experience into them. For bootcamp I learnt Ruby fairly rapidly as well as spent two weeks learning the MERN stack in order to submit a project written in it at the end of the two weeks. Ruby as a language is really simple and rarely gets in the way so was a great introductory language to learning testing which carried over to Javascript and Golang.
