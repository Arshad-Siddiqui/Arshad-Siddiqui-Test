## About Me

A highly inquisitive and enthusiastic software developer and recent graduate from Makers Academy, bringing in a strong foundation in full-stack web development. Previously, I honed my skills through self-study with online resources, gaining a solid understanding of programming fundamentals. My time at Makers Academy further developed these skills, as I learned best practices for writing clean, test driven code as well as collaborated in groups to build full-stack projects which helped boost my communication and teamwork skills.

What made me want to become a developer was the fun and engaging problem solving loop that rewards you for learning from mistakes. The vast resources available for learning it are very accessible so I was able to experience coding at a young age and have been hooked ever since. I'm looking for a role where I can continue to learn and improve my skills as well as help others do the same.

## Work Experience

Iceland Foods (2017 - current)

Sales Assistant

- Ensure effective communication with customers to share information in a polite and efficient way.
- Maintain organisation to improve productivity for me and my colleagues.
- Quickly adapt to store conditions and correctly prioritise the most critical work.
- Manage tills, put out stock and prepare deliveries.
- Check products are in date and ensure inventory count is accurate.
- Distribute out work to newer staff members with the goal of easing them in and matching the load to their ability.

## Skills

**Team Player**

- I always try and be helpful. An example being when we were looking to add swipe functionality to an [app](https://github.com/Dmum303/MERNsters-inc), which none of us had experience with, and I strategically volunteered to learn and employ the tech for this which lead to the team being able to focus on solving other problems and increase our overall speed.
- Whenever I find a useful resource that helped me I would share it with the team so we could all benefit from it. Usually this would be a blog post or video that explained a concept in a way that made sense to me.
- In labs where we were given a task to complete in a group, I would work flexibly to what the team needed. That includes taking on more challenging work and offering leadership where required.
- At Iceland's I am capable of working in most roles and am able to adapt to any situation. This also means when staff members go sick I am often asked to cover their shifts as I am reliable and can be trusted to do the job well.

**Self motivated**

- I'm always working on side projects with the goals of widening my knowledge. For example, I took on the goal of creating a multiplayer Monopoly game which is a big step up from creating CRUD applications. Overall, challenging myself regularly keeps me engaged and helps me learn new skills.
- I recently took on the challenge of learning Go in order to produce performant, microservice style backends, as well as increase comfort writing in new languages/paradigms. Go is a slightly less popular language meaning resources for learning it are limited so I had to improve my ability to learn from documentation.
- To keep myself immersed in this field I follow a number of blogs and YouTube channels. This helps me stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies as well as learn new concepts and techniques. For example, my understanding of the importance of docker and microservices was greatly improved by watching these type of videos.

**Adaptable**

- When teaching myself coding I found that I had a natural aptitude for it. This meant I was able to quickly adapt to Makers Academy's curriculum and was able to pick up new concepts and technologies quickly. This made the transition from Javascript to Ruby (and then to Go) much easier than I expected. This allowed me to offer help to others even when working in a language I have never used before.

**Great Attention to detail**

- I thoroughly test merged code before pushing to the main branch. I always make sure my contributions only do what they are supposed to do and don't break anything else. I am also very strict with following the style guide such as with commit names and file structure.
- Usually a high degree of precision is required in order to collect lab results, which I was able to do by carefully following instructions and double checking my work. Otherwise small mistakes would add up and correlations would be missed.
- At my retail job, I am often asked to check the stock count as I am able to spot mistakes and inconsistencies. I am often given the responsibility of re-organising the stock room as I am able to quickly find the most efficient way to do so.
- Having code that simply works isn't enough for me, I like to make sure it is as efficient as possible, whilst also being maintainable, and that it is easy to read and understand. When completing the 'Bank Tech Test' I employed SOLID and OOP principles which overall made the code easier to extend and maintain.

**Customer focused**

- Conversing with many customers daily has helped me develop my communication skills. My strong pattern recognition skills helps me anticipate a customer's needs allowing me to help them more efficiently.
- I keep to company policy despite the fact that it can be frustrating for customers. This is because I understand that it is important to follow the rules in order to maintain a good reputation and keep the business running smoothly.

### Technology

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript (React, Node, Express, Jest)
- Ruby (Rspec, Sinatra)
- Go (net/http library, Fiber, testing library + testify/Ginkgo, GORM)
- MongoDb/Postgres
- Firebase, Postman, Heroku, TablePlus
- Docker

## Education

**Makers Academy (September to December 2022)**

Intense, highly selective, 16 week software bootcamp

- TDD, SOLID, MVC: Learnt processes and design patterns in order to write maintainable, collaborative code.
- Agile/XP: Using group work/pair programming, often whilst remote, in order to complete projects by a deadline.
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec: Used this simple language to learn the fundamentals of programming and web development that eased us into more complex work.
- Javascript, Jest: Used for writing client and server side code.
- Database management: Interacted with SQL as well as NoSQL databases through code as well as the command line in order to build projects. We created our own database management classes as well as used ORMs.
- MERN: Built a facebook clone and friendmaking app where everyone got to experience coding in both sides of the stack.

**University of Southampton (2017-2020)**

BSC: Biochemistry

Lab experience, writing papers and self-directed learning.

Dissertation: ​​Screen of known kinase inhibitors to eEF2K homology model with structure analysis.​ (Used computers to model the structure of a protein and then used this to screen for inhibitors as a potential treatment for cancer.)

Improved research and communication skills by collaborating with others on the course.

**Barton Peveril College (2015-2017)**

A Levels: Biology(A\*), Chemistry(B), Maths(B)

Was able to further develop problem solving skills by learning scientific processes.
